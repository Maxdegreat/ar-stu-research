The Detect algorithm uses a graph to which consist of 16 keys. The keys are

0: nose ...
1: leftEye ...
2: rightEye ...
3: leftEar ...
4: rightEar ...
5: leftSholder ...
6: rightSholder ...
7: leftElbow ...
8: rightElbow ...
9: leftWrist ...
10: rightWrist ...
11: leftHip ...
12: rightHip ...
13: leftKnee ...
14: rightKnee ...
15: leftAnkle ...
16: rightAnkle ...

Because the test case for this application is to make sure a person is studying and not distracted we can make several assumptions.
The first assumption is that the web cam should not be able to detect key points 11 through 16. This is because the environment for
this test is controlled and it is assumed that the subject is siting at a desk where their hip is below the point of vision for the camera.

We should be able to always view keypoints 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6. if any of these keypoints are not visible then we can make the assumption that the
subject is distracted.

We should not be able to go more than 10 seconds without seeing the all keypoints 0 though 6.

if at any point we can see keypoints 7 through 10 for more than 10 seconds we should add this to our third assumption and if it is then added
we should always be able to see said keypoint. else we reduce the attention point by 1 for every second we do not see the keypoint.

How point are added and reduced. A point is added if all keypoint that are ment to be seen are visible per persecond. else a point is reduced.

What do points mean? a point
