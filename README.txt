Hi world!

What is this: This school project uses TensorFlow.js to monitor a student's attention during their study sessions. If the student is focused, attention points are added to a positive counter. If the student is not focused, non-attentive points are added to a negative counter. After the designated study period has ended, a review column will display the student's overall attention behavior and the times they lost focus, indicated by the absence of keypoints detected by TensorFlow, on the left side of the screen.

next goals: To implement OpenAi for better auto generated Review algorithem outputs.

Technologys: Tensorflow.js | React.js | Redux Tool Kit |

Dependencies: Please see package.json
